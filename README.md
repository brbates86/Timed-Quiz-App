# Timed-Quiz-App

In this weeks challenge we were given the objective to create a timed coding quiz.
I began with creating the structure of the application using HTML. After creating the 
structure of the application I styled it with CSS giving it a unique style and coloring of my choice.
I was then tasked to apply javascript to the timed quiz. The application is supposed to ask the user
questions and provide possible answers to the questions. When the answer is wrong time is subtracted
from remaing time. Try it out for yourself!
